I created this project to play with user authentification, JSON web tokens and mongodb queries through Mongoose.

Note: At some point of the app I use an Ajax DELETE query. Alas, it is not supported by some mobile browsers. 
If you want to give it a try, Google Chrome for Windows is your best friend.
